# Automations

![Shell automations for productivity and fun](./docs/automations-logo.png)

This repo will hold an expanding series of shell scripts that handle issues near and dear to my heart. Now I pass them on to you, to adapt, use or modify as you see fit!

These automations leverage [github.com/charmbracelet/mods](https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods) and [github.com/charmbracelet/glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow).

## Current automations

### `autogit`

![autogit is a shell script that handles git fetching, branch pruning and more](./docs/autogit-master-main.gif)

autogit's goal is to ensure you're always working with the latest code, because even experienced developers forget to `git pull` at the least opportune times.

### `autoreview`

`autoreview` is a shell script that performs a detailed code review of your stashed git changes.
